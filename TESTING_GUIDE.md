# üöÄ Quick Start - Testing Your New Login

## Ready to Test!

Your Supabase authentication is now live and ready to test. Follow these simple steps:

## 1. Start Your Development Server

```bash
cd "c:\Users\RAJEEV CHAUDHARY\OneDrive\Desktop\Projects\New folder"
npm run dev
# or
bun dev
```

## 2. Open Your Browser

Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/login`

## 3. Test Login

### Use any existing app user credentials:

**Example:**

- Email: `dahiyatarun1201@gmail.com` (from your database)
- Password: [The password they use in the app]

## 4. What Should Happen:

‚úÖ **Successful Login:**

1. Email and password validated
2. Supabase authenticates the user
3. Profile data loaded from database
4. Redirected to `/dashboard`
5. User name and business name displayed
6. All user data accessible (customers, suppliers, etc.)

‚ùå **Failed Login:**

- Clear error message displayed
- Rate limiting after 5 attempts
- No security information leaked

## 5. Test Other Features:

### Session Persistence:

1. Log in successfully
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. Should remain logged in

### Logout:

1. Click logout button (if available in UI)
2. Or call `logout()` function
3. Should redirect to landing page
4. Cannot access `/dashboard` without logging in again

### Auto-Logout (Inactivity):

1. Log in
2. Don't interact for 2 hours
3. Should automatically log out

### Rate Limiting:

1. Try logging in with wrong password 6 times
2. After 5 attempts, should block for 15 minutes
3. Shows: "Too many login attempts. Please try again in 15 minutes."

## 6. Verify User Data:

After logging in, check:

- User name displays correctly
- Business name appears (if user has business_settings)
- All existing data is accessible:
  - Customers list
  - Suppliers list
  - Transactions
  - Invoices
  - Staff
  - Cash Book entries

## 7. Developer Tools Check:

### Open Browser Console (F12):

**Look for:**

- ‚úÖ No authentication errors
- ‚úÖ "Auth state changed: SIGNED_IN" message
- ‚úÖ User profile loaded successfully
- ‚úÖ No CORS errors
- ‚úÖ No RLS policy violations

**Network Tab:**

- ‚úÖ POST request to Supabase auth endpoint
- ‚úÖ 200 OK response
- ‚úÖ Session token received

**Application Tab ‚Üí Local Storage:**

- ‚úÖ `sb-<project>-auth-token` present
- ‚úÖ `secure_auth_user` present
- ‚úÖ `secure_last_activity` present

## 8. Test Different User Types:

Try logging in with:

1. User with full profile (full_name set)
2. User with business settings (owner_name set)
3. User with neither (should show email or "User")

## 9. Security Tests:

### Invalid Email Format:

```
Input: "notanemail"
Expected: "Please enter a valid email address"
```

### Empty Fields:

```
Input: Empty email or password
Expected: "Please enter both email and password"
```

### Wrong Password:

```
Input: Correct email, wrong password
Expected: "Invalid email or password"
```

### Non-existent Email:

```
Input: Email not in database
Expected: "Invalid email or password"
```

## 10. Mobile App Integration Test:

1. Create new user in mobile app
2. Use same credentials to log in to website
3. Verify all data synced properly
4. Make changes on website
5. Check if visible in mobile app (if real-time sync enabled)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Login Button Shows "Signing in..." Forever:

**Check:**

1. Network connection
2. Supabase project is running
3. Environment variables are correct
4. Browser console for errors

**Fix:**

```bash
# Verify .env file
cat .env

# Should show:
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://cngshsloibqlkoebbwym.supabase.co
# VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=eyJhbGc...
```

### "Invalid login credentials" for Valid User:

**Possible Causes:**

1. Email not confirmed in Supabase Auth
2. User account disabled
3. Incorrect password

**Check Supabase Dashboard:**

- Go to Authentication ‚Üí Users
- Find the user by email
- Check "Confirmed At" column
- Verify user is not banned

### Session Not Persisting:

**Check:**

1. Browser localStorage enabled
2. No private/incognito mode issues
3. No browser extensions blocking storage

**Clear and Retry:**

```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.clear();
// Then try logging in again
```

### RLS Policy Errors:

**Symptoms:** "new row violates row-level security policy"

**Fix:** Already handled! All RLS policies are properly configured. If you see this:

1. Check user_id is correctly set
2. Verify Supabase session is valid
3. Check browser console for auth errors

### Rate Limiting False Positives:

If you're testing and get rate limited:

**Quick Fix:**

```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.removeItem("rateLimit_login_youremail@example.com");
```

Or wait 15 minutes.
