## 🎨 Understanding Attendance Status

| Status | Color | Salary Impact | Leave Impact |
|--------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **Present** | 🟢 Green | 100% of daily salary | No impact |
| **Half Day** | 🟠 Orange | 50% of daily salary | No impact |
| **Leave** | 🟣 Indigo | 100% if within quota, 0% if excess | Deducted from quota |
| **Absent** | 🔴 Red | 0% salary | No deduction from leave quota |
| **Unmarked** | ⚪ Gray | Ignored in calculations | N/A |

### Leave Quota Example
- Staff has 2 paid leaves per month
- Takes 3 leaves total:
  - First 2 = Paid (100% salary)
  - 3rd leave = Unpaid (0% salary)
- Takes 1 leave:
  - 1 paid leave used
  - 1 remaining

## 💰 Salary Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Perfect Attendance
```
Staff: John Doe
Monthly Salary: ₹30,000
Days in Month: 30
Status: Simple Mode (100% Basic, no PF/ESI)

Attendance:
- Present: 30 days
- Half: 0
- Leave: 0
- Absent: 0

Calculation:
Daily Salary = ₹30,000 / 30 = ₹1,000
Earnings = 30 × ₹1,000 = ₹30,000
Deductions = ₹0
Net Pay = ₹30,000
```

### Example 2: With Leaves & Half Days
```
Staff: Jane Smith
Monthly Salary: ₹40,000
Days in Month: 30
Allowed Leaves: 2 per month
Status: Simple Mode

Attendance:
- Present: 24 days
- Half: 2 days
- Leave: 3 days (2 paid + 1 unpaid)
- Absent: 1 day

Calculation:
Daily Salary = ₹40,000 / 30 = ₹1,333.33
Present Earnings = 24 × ₹1,333.33 = ₹32,000
Half Day Earnings = 2 × (₹1,333.33 / 2) = ₹1,333.33
Paid Leave Earnings = 2 × ₹1,333.33 = ₹2,666.67
Total Earned = ₹36,000
Attendance Deduction = ₹40,000 - ₹36,000 = ₹4,000
Net Pay = ₹40,000 - ₹4,000 = ₹36,000
```

### Example 3: Advanced Mode with PF
```
Staff: Mike Johnson
Monthly Salary: ₹50,000
Days in Month: 30
Status: Advanced Mode
- Basic: 50% = ₹25,000
- HRA: 30% = ₹15,000
- Allowances: ₹5,000
- PF: 12% enabled

Attendance:
- Present: 28 days
- Half: 0
- Leave: 0
- Absent: 2 days

Calculation:
Daily Salary = ₹50,000 / 30 = ₹1,666.67
Present Earnings = 28 × ₹1,666.67 = ₹46,666.67
Attendance Deduction = ₹50,000 - ₹46,666.67 = ₹3,333.33
PF Deduction = ₹46,666.67 × 12% = ₹5,600
Gross Earnings = ₹25,000 + ₹15,000 + ₹5,000 = ₹45,000
Total Deductions = ₹3,333.33 + ₹5,600 = ₹8,933.33
Net Pay = ₹45,000 - ₹8,933.33 = ₹36,066.67
```
