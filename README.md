## SEO Enhancements

This project includes production-ready SEO setup aligned with Google's SEO starter guide:

- index.html: Optimized title, meta description, keywords, robots, canonical, Open Graph, Twitter Card, and JSON-LD (Organization + SoftwareApplication).
- public/robots.txt: Allows crawling and references sitemap.xml.
- public/sitemap.xml: Lists key routes; update as routes change.
- public/manifest.json and favicons: PWA metadata and icons.

Maintenance tips:

- Keep the homepage title and description concise (50–60 chars for title, ~155–160 chars for description).
- When adding new top-level routes, add them to sitemap.xml and deploy.
- Ensure the site is served with a single preferred domain (www or apex) and HTTPS.
- Use meaningful headings and alt text inside pages; avoid duplicating titles across routes.
