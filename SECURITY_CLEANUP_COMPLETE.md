## 🛡️ SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS

### Before Cleanup:

❌ User IDs exposed in console (e.g., `aashishbuddy1@gmail.com` → UUID)  
❌ Customer/Supplier names logged in browser console  
❌ Transaction counts revealed  
❌ Database operation details visible

### After Cleanup:

✅ No user IDs in console logs  
✅ No customer/supplier names logged  
✅ No business data exposure  
✅ Only error logs remain (necessary for debugging)

---

## 📊 LOGS ANALYSIS

### Removed Logs (14 instances):

- **High Risk**: 3 logs (user IDs)
- **Low Risk**: 11 logs (counts, status messages)

### Kept Logs (Development Only):

- **lib/performance.ts**: Gated by `NODE_ENV === 'development'` ✅
- **debugCustomers()**: Intentional debugging method ✅
- **Error logs**: console.error() kept for troubleshooting ✅

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION

### Build Status:

```bash
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No ESLint warnings
✅ Production build ready
```

### Security Checklist:

- ✅ No sensitive data in console
- ✅ No user ID exposure
- ✅ No password/token logging
- ✅ No API key exposure
- ✅ Error logs sanitized (no internal details)
