## 🔥 Key Features

### Smart Validations

```typescript
✅ Quantity must be greater than 0
✅ Price must be non-negative
✅ Stock Out cannot exceed available stock
✅ Real-time error messages in the UI
```

### Intelligent Cost Calculation

```typescript
// Weighted Average Cost Price for Stock In
const oldStockValue = currentQty × currentCostPrice
const newStockValue = addedQty × purchasePrice
const newCostPrice = (oldStockValue + newStockValue) / totalQty

Example:
- Current: 100 units @ ₹50 = ₹5,000
- Purchase: 50 units @ ₹60 = ₹3,000
- New Cost: ₹8,000 ÷ 150 = ₹53.33 per unit ✓
```

### Real-time Preview

- **Transaction Amount**: Quantity × Price
- **New Stock Level**: Current ± Transaction Quantity
- **New Avg. Cost** (Stock In only): Weighted average
- **Visual Warnings**: Red text for invalid operations

### Professional UI/UX

- ✅ Loading spinners during processing
- ✅ Disabled buttons while loading
- ✅ Success/error toast notifications
- ✅ Form auto-reset after successful transaction
- ✅ Modal can't be closed during processing
- ✅ Currency formatting using CurrencyContext
- ✅ Dark mode compatible

## 🗄️ Database Integration

### Tables Used

1. **`inventory`**: Products with quantity and cost_price
2. **`stock_transactions`**: Transaction history

### Transaction Record

```typescript
{
  id: "TXN-timestamp-random",
  user_id: "authenticated-user-id",
  product_id: "product-id",
  type: "in" | "out",
  quantity: number,
  price: number,  // Purchase price for IN, Selling price for OUT
  amount: quantity × price,
  note: "optional note",
  timestamp: ISO timestamp,
  created_at, updated_at, synced_at
}
```

### Product Updates

- **Stock In**:
  - `quantity` increases
  - `cost_price` updates to weighted average
- **Stock Out**:
  - `quantity` decreases
  - `cost_price` remains unchanged
